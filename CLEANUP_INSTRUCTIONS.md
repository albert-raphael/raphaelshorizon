Repository cleanup completed (removal of large Electron/build artifacts)

What I did
- Removed large build artifacts and Electron-related binaries from the Git history using `git-filter-repo` (filters: `dist/`, `dist-local/`, `local-dist/`, `local-dist2/`, `win-unpacked/`, `electron/binaries/`, `node_modules/electron/` and `node_modules/app-builder-bin/`, and file globs `*.exe` and `*.asar`).
- Committed updates to `.gitignore` to prevent future accidental commits of these directories.
- Pushed cleaned history to `origin` (force-pushed). A backup branch was created before the operation: `backup-before-filter-20260104`.
- Moved local build artifacts into a local `.build_backups/backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` directory (if present). Do not commit these; they're excluded via `.gitignore`.

Important notes for collaborators
1. REVOKE exposed tokens immediately (if you accidentally pasted a PAT in console). Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and revoke any token starting with `ghp_` you may have created accidentally.
2. This repository history has been rewritten and force-pushed. Everyone who has a clone must re-clone the repository to avoid unpleasant merges and history conflicts:

   # Recommended: fresh clone
   git clone https://github.com/albert-raphael/raphaelshorizon.git

   # If you must keep your local repo, you can reset it -- WARNING: this will overwrite local branches
   git fetch origin --prune
   git checkout --force main
   git reset --hard origin/main

3. A backup of pre-filtered history is available in `backup-before-filter-20260104` on `origin` (do not base new work on it; it exists only for recovery).

4. If you rely on any large binaries that we removed, consider storing them outside the git repository (Git LFS or external artifact storage like GitHub Releases or cloud storage). I can help migrate selected binaries to Git LFS if you want.

If you'd like, I can:
- Trigger the CI "Build Electron App" workflow for a commit or tag to verify the packaging artifacts (I will need a PAT with `repo` + `workflow` scopes, or you can run the provided curl/PowerShell dispatch commands locally),
- Help migrate any needed binaries to Git LFS, or
- Contact GitHub Support to remove orphaned LFS objects if you need help reducing remote storage usage.
